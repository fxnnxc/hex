# Measuring_Augmentation_Effects_with_Central_Kernel_Alignment


# Experiment Description

In this experiment, 
we demonstrate that there is no trivial affects on CNN representations 
with noise data augmentation. The authors measure the CNN feature similarity with 
Central Kernel Alignment. 


# Menu Script

```bash 
# first train cnn models with CIFAR10 dataset
python train.py 

# run jupyter notebook
```
